Tried fyne for admin interface. Didn't cut it. I stumbled on a table widget. It doesn't auto-expand the column/cell width, so the content is all garbled.I couldn't figure out how to implement this and anyway, this should be baked in, along with resize controls, perhaps even sort controls. The usual stuff.So I have to drop fine and go back to admin interface via http.
The initial impulse to try fyne was to get away from the html/css/javascript template madness to a more object oriented and cross platform solution. Oh well, back to the square one.
